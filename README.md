- [x] Complete
- [ ] Implemented / Need More Test

### INSTALATION:

* The Warthog Script can be run from any location. All files from __Thrustmaster Warthog Script__ folder need to be in the same folder.
* Copy the Elite Dangerous Binds Profile __ED+HCS V2.2.03.3b.1.8.binds__ from __Default Keybinds - Elite Dangerous__ Folder to:
```
\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings
```

* Just Drag&Drop __ED+HCS v2.2.tmc__ to TARGET Script Editor and Run. (Default script path can also be set in the options). Always make sure the script is running prior to starting Elite Dangerous.
* Most commands can be tested prior to starting the game in Target Script Editor using the Debug Message, Event Tester and Device Analyzer.

### BEFORE FLYING:

The Script work with a lot of States value. Some of them are very important:

 * Landing Gear Switch (Throttle EAC Switch) state is Switch Down : Retracted / Switch Up : Deployed
 
 * Cargo Scoop Switch (Throttle RDR ALTM Switch) state is Switch Down : Retracted / Switch Up : Deployed

 * Harpoints (Joystick MASTER Mode Control Button Longpress) is a press Button, so no switch state. You need to know, it start retracted in Script
 

When you launch the Game, the script start with this states (according the switch position for LGears and CScoop). 
If, for example, hardpoints is already deployed you should "tell" to the script it is without sending Command Key ; Press [S3] and Joystick MASTER Mode Control Button Longpress, to "align" the Harpoints state betwen game and script.
That goes for LGears and CScoop to. You can Switch the states without sending game commands, like previously, Press [S3] and switch LGears or/and CScoop if "mis aligned" 

The Optimal PIP Mode, make Backup of Previous engaged PIP. By Default it will return to //2 SYS 2 ENG 2 WEP (0) if you don't make change before deploying Hardpoints or Fire after the game launch. 
I suggest, when you launch the game, to make one change to PIP before deploying hardpoints and another before fire, so the script can backup those value.

Because of all this tracking states in the script, __HCS User should use L.Gears, C.Scoop, Hardpoints, and PIP on HOTAS__. Other commands should be OK to use via HCS
