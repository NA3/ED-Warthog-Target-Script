ED_API_over_TCP.exe NEED to be placed in the same directory as Status.json and other log/json ED files :
```
\Users\<USER>\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\
```
This exe file is, right now, in beta stage

* You need to use the script provided this branch for using it
* You should get Flags value and time it have been sent to target in the main windows console program
